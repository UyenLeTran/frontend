        <p class="react-blog">This blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important,
            including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted here first. You can also
            follow the <span>@reactjs</span> account on Twitter, but you won't miss anything essential if you only
            read this blog.</p>

            <h2>React Labs: What We've Been Working On - February 2024</h2>
            <span class="blog-date">February 15, 2024</span>
            <p>
                In React Labs posts, we write about projects in active research and development. Since our last
                update, we've made significant progress on React Compiler, new features, and React 19, and
                we'd like to share what we learned.

            <h2>React Canaries: Incremental Feature Rollout Outside Meta</h2>
            <span class="blog-date">May 3, 2023</span>
            <p>
                Traditionally, new React features used to only be available at Meta first, and land in the open
source releases later. We'd like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual new
features as soon as their design is close to finalâ€”similar to how Meta uses React internally. We
are introducing a new officially supported Canary release channel. It lets curated setups like
frameworks decouple adoption of individual React features from the React release schedule.
